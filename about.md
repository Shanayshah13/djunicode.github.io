[Unicode](https://www.github.com/djunicode) is an initiative started by 5 senior-year students 
of Computer Engineering with the aim of fostering the spirit 
of open-source development among their peers and juniors, 
helping them build a rapport with each other, and 
promoting knowledge transfer whilst building a sustainable community.

The idea was to emulate a summer-of-code in a longer, localized, 
and more interactive manner. Teams included multiple students 
at the sophomore and junior level communicating for the most part 
over Slack, Hangouts, with the occasional in-person meeting. Each 
team was guided by a senior-year undergrad who served as an advisor 
and reviewer for the team progress.

The hierarchy ensured the most of the learning and programming was 
the responsibility of the sophomores who also owned their product 
completely. They had internal teams focused on frontend, backend, 
and REST API each of whom reported to the junior-year undergrad 
students who handled the mjore granular tasks pertaining to the 
project. We hold weekly/bimonthly calls to discuss next steps 
or take collective decisions - this is moderated by the seniors. 
In this manner, Unicode turns into a highly structured organization 
that was able to successfully drive multiple projects to completion, 
to a level where even the sophomores who were just beginning to learn 
the technologies are now perfectly comfortable working in a professional 
setting.

Starting off with minimal knowledge of Django, React, and Android, 
our students have built 3 webapps and 2 Android applications over 
a semester of remote collaboration. In a moment of pride for us, 
all of them have received offers to work/intern with companies 
spread across the country. 

### Our Students
